    <h3 class="grey--text text--lighten-1 text-center">This website and the lamp it controls was created as a school project by students attending ABB Industrigymnasium, 2020.
      <br> <br> The purpose of this project was to construct a "smart" lamp and to control it in a smart way using a website. With this website, it is possible to control the color and brightness as well as the on-state with a simple on/off switch.
      <br> <br> It is also possible lock the lampâ€™s state by logging in as an administrator. By locking it only people with the correct username and password will be able to edit the lamp's values.
