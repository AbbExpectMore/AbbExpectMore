## What is this?
This is a website written in [vue](https://vuejs.org/) with [vuetifyjs](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/). It controls a lamp which was created as a school project by students attending ABB Industrigymnasium, 2020.

## What's the purpose?
The purpose of this project was to construct a "smart" lamp and to control it in a smart way such as using a website. With this website, it is possible to control the color and brightness of the lamp aswell as some special color programs

## What other features does it have?
It's possible lock the lampâ€™s state by logging in as an administrator. By locking it, only people with the correct username and password will be able to edit the current setting of the lamp.

## This seams like a really cool project, how do I contribute?
